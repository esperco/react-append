React Position
==============
WIP: Helpers and tools for managing dropdowns, tooltips, and other absolutely
positioned overlays in React. Features elements that re-position themselves
when they extend offscreen.

Not intended for use as actual components but as helper components to
add in positioning logic into React tooltips and dropdowns.
